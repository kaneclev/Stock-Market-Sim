# Stock Market Simulation Project

This is all the code for Project 3.

This project was to create a stock market simulation with a list of functionalities, including the ability to process a file
of buy/sell orders given prices, stock numbers, trader ID's, and so on. 

Additionally, the program can run in a variety of 'modes', including Verbose, Trader Info, and Median.

### NOTE: the 'P2Random.java' file is NOT my work, it is my professor's work in order to randomize buy/sell orders to test against my program.
