# Stock Market Simulation Project


This project was to create a stock market simulation with a list of functionalities, including the ability to process a file
of buy/sell orders given prices, stock numbers, trader ID's, and so on. 

Additionally, the program can run in a variety of 'modes', including Verbose, Trader Info, and Median.
